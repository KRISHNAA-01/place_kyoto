      <p style="font-size: larger;"><h2 style="display: inline;">Kyoto</h2> is a historic city located in the Kansai region of Japan.</p>
       Once the imperial capital for over a thousand years, Kyoto is known for its rich cultural heritage, traditional wooden houses, ancient temples, and beautiful gardens. <br>The city is home to <h3 style="display: inline;">17 UNESCO World Heritage Sites</h3>, including Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion), Ginkaku-ji (Silver Pavilion), and the iconic Fushimi Inari Shrine with its thousands of red torii gates. Kyoto is also famous for its seasonal beauty — cherry blossoms in spring, vibrant foliage in autumn, and snowy temple rooftops in winter. Traditional arts like tea ceremony, flower arranging (ikebana), and geisha performances are still practiced here. Kyoto cuisine, including kaiseki (a multi-course meal), tofu dishes, and matcha-based sweets, reflects the city’s elegant and refined style. Whether you're walking through bamboo groves in Arashiyama or exploring hidden alleyways in Gion, Kyoto offers a timeless blend of history, spirituality, and natural beauty.
